\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}

I would like to express my gratitude to the developers and maintainers of
\texttt{LiquidHaskell}, whose research and documentation provided the foundation
for this work.

I also acknowledge the use of AI-assisted tools during the preparation of this thesis. 
GitHub Copilot was used for minor code auto-completion and formatting suggestions.
Large Language Models such as ChatGPT and Gemini were consulted to help improve
grammar, refine phrasing, and summarize background literature for clarity.
All technical contributions, research decisions, and verification work remain
my sole responsibility.
