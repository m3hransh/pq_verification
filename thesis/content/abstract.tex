		Formal program verification is a powerful approach to ensuring the correctness of software systems.
		However, traditional verification methods are often tedious,
		requiring significant manual effort and specialized tools or languages \cite{rondonLiquidTypes2008}.

		This thesis explores \texttt{LiquidHaskell},
		a refinement type system for Haskell that integrates SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solvers to enable automated verification of program properties \cite{vazou2018}.
		We demonstrate how Liquid Haskell can be used to verify correctness of priority queue implementations in Haskell.
		By combining type specifications with Haskellâ€™s expressive language features,
		we show that \texttt{LiquidHaskell} allows for concise and automated verification with minimal annotation overhead.
