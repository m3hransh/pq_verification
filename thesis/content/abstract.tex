		Formal program verification is a powerful approach to ensuring
		the correctness of software systems.
		However, traditional verification methods are often tedious,
		requiring significant manual effort and specialized tools or languages.

		This thesis explores Liquid Haskell, a refinement type
		system for Haskell that integrates SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)
		solvers to enable automated verification of program properties.
		We demonstrate how Liquid Haskell can be used to verify
		correctness of priority queue
		implementations in Haskell.
		By combining type specifications with Haskellâ€™s expressive
		language features, we show that Liquid Haskell allows for concise
		and automated verification with minimal annotation overhead.
